### Project Title

Grimorie: A Choose Your Own Adventure Maker

### What and why?

This web application is designed to help people who are interested in either creating their own CYOA tales or playing them, stored all on one site for convenience. This makes it easier to find stories and genres that someone wants to play through as well as a place for creators to have other users try their works.

### For whom?

This would be for anyone interested in playing or making CYOA type stories. This could be any individual person or group of people interested in this.

### How?

1. A first time user would be able to make their own account by inputting some basic login information. After logging in, they will be brought to a main page giving a rundown of the purpose of the webapp. From there, they can decide whether they want to browse and play any of the user-made CYOA stories or make their own.

2. If they decided to play some CYOA stories, they can look through a list of made stories in a master list area. If they wish to find a specific genre or title, there would be a search function that would sort by either title or genre/tags. Accessing each story on the master list would bring the user to the story's description page and the option to either return to the master list or begin playing the CYOA tale. They can also give thumbs up and thumbs down to stories that they may have liked or disliked.

3. If they wanted to write their own stories, there would be a CYOA maker that would allow for the creation of story cards and a way to link the story cards to build the road map of their CYOA. They would be able to save this to a collective database that would store it for other users. In addition, creators would be able to edit and delete their stories on a user specific story list.

### Scope

This project would focus mainly on the maker portion of the programming, as it would be the most difficult to implement. It should be something that would make it convenient to write out each story choice and match each story choice to a predecessor except for the beginning card. In addition, we would have to make sure that each ending card gives an option to return to the story's description page or the master list page. The playing aspect would need to have pages for users to read from the stories written and given specific choice buttons that creators gave options to.

The division of work should be reasonable, with the bulk of the work focusing mainly on the creation aspect and the playing aspect. We would also want to give a lot of thought on how everything will look, if pictures should be included, and if we should allow certain features to come to. However, the bare bone implementation of this project should be reasonable for 4-6 programmers to undertake. If it was too easy, then we'll rely on the creative process to add additional features to make it more interesting.
